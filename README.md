# Module 3 -  Final Project
## S. Nathaniel Cibik

### Description:
This repository contains the jupyter notebooks made during my data exploration and testing of the Northwind Traders dataset, as well as a package of functions written to facilitate the process. There is also folder containing saved visualizations for the blog post.

### Notebooks:
1. data_exploration.ipynb -> Contains the original data exploration steps, as well as the statistical testing for effects of discounts on order totals and item quantities
2. customer_discounts.ipynb -> Explores the effects of discount on customer buying behavior.
3. copy_for_making_visualizations.ipynb -> copy of notebook 1 for generating graphs
4. cost_per_item.ipynb -> Explores effect of discount on average cost paid per item within orders.

### Conclusions:
It was found that Northwind Traders should offer discounts on items which average 5% across an order, on 30-50% of a customer's orders in order to generate optimal positive effects on buying behavior, as larger or more frequent discounts did not improve the effects further, and only served to reduce profit made by NT on an order.
